#Data-mining
Data mining project to understand what contributes to a high rated dark chocolate bar.
Where are the best cocoa beans grown based on the highest-rated chocolate bars? Which countries produce the highest-rated or lowest-rated bars? Is there a connection between cocoa solids percentage and bar rating? We aim to answer these questions using the Over 2,300 Plain Dark Chocolate Bars Rated! database that provides chocolate manufacturer, company location, bean origin, ingredients, characteristics, and rating. We also can answer which countries have the highest-rated chocolate on average.

Data: 
10 columns, 2362 rows; Bategorical and continuous types of data. 
Mean Rating is found to be 3.19
Mean Cocoa Percentage is found to be 71.62%
Mean number of ingredients was not produced as there are missing values. Preprocessing will be done on the data to impute the missing values. 
Missing values: We will be using the mean strategy to impute the missing values in the NumberOfIngredients column. 
Type conversions: The Cocoa percentage is converted to Float from percentage value in order to do descriptive analysis on it.
